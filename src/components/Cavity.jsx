              A cavity, also known as dental caries or tooth decay, is permanent damage to the tooth's hard surface, resulting in tiny holes or openings. It occurs when bacteria in the mouth interact with sugars and starches from food, producing acids that erode the protective enamel. Over time, these acid attacks can break down enamel, forming cavities.

              Common Causes

            <Typography variant="body1" className="cavity-text" gutterBottom>
              Poor oral hygiene is a primary cause of cavities. Inadequate brushing and flossing allow plaque‚Äîa sticky bacterial film‚Äîto accumulate on teeth. Sugary or starchy foods and drinks, like candy, soda, or processed snacks, fuel acid-producing bacteria. Dry mouth, caused by reduced saliva production, also heightens cavity risk, as saliva neutralizes acids and clears food particles.

              Age Groups Most Affected
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" className="cavity-text">
              Cavities can affect anyone, but children and teenagers are particularly susceptible due to their diets, developing teeth, and sometimes inconsistent brushing habits. Older adults face higher risks due to gum recession and medication-induced dry mouth. Toddlers are also prone to "baby bottle tooth decay" from prolonged exposure to sugary drinks or milk.
