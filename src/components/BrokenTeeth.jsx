          A broken tooth is a common dental issue that can result from trauma, biting on hard objects, or untreated cavities weakening the tooth structure. Depending on the severity, a broken tooth can cause pain, sensitivity, and difficulty chewing. It is important to seek dental care promptly to prevent further damage or infection.
        </p>
        <h1>Common Causes:</h1>
        <p>
          Broken teeth are often caused by accidents, sports injuries, or falls. Biting down on hard foods like ice, nuts, or candy can also lead to fractures. Untreated cavities or large fillings can weaken the tooth, making it more prone to breaking. Teeth grinding (bruxism) and aging restorations like crowns or fillings can also contribute to tooth fractures.
        </p>
        <h1>Treatment Options:</h1>
        <p>
          Treatment for a broken tooth depends on the extent of the damage. For minor cracks, dental bonding or polishing may be sufficient. For more severe fractures, a crown or veneer may be needed to restore the tooth's shape and function. If the break exposes the pulp, a root canal may be required. In cases where the tooth cannot be saved, extraction followed by a dental implant or bridge may be recommended.
